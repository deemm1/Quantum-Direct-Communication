# Quantum-Direct-Communication

In today's world, the need to transfer sensitive data across various sectors is ever-present. However, traditional encryption methods using keys , while effective to a certain extent, are susceptible to attackers trying to decrypt the file without key or quantum computing advancements that could potentially compromise their security. 

To address these vulnerabilities, we have developed a two-step Quantum Direct Communication Protocol. This protocol introduces an additional layer of security by enabling direct communication between two parties, thus mitigating the risks associated with traditional encryption methods.
