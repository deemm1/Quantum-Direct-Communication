# Two-step QSDC : Two-step quantum secure direct communication

In today's world, the need to transfer sensitive data across various sectors is ever-present. However, traditional encryption methods using keys , while effective to a certain extent, are susceptible to attackers trying to decrypt the file without key or quantum computing advancements that could potentially compromise their security. 

To address these vulnerabilities, We present Quantum communication as Two-step Quantum Secure Direct Communication Protocol. This protocol introduces an additional layer of security by enabling direct communication between two parties, thus mitigating the risks associated with traditional encryption methods.
